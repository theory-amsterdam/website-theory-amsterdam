My area of research within computer science is algorithms and data structures. Research topics I am interested in include algorithms and data structures on strings and trees for pattern matching, indexing, comparison, and finding regularities. Applications thereof I am interested in include bioinformatics, data mining, data compression, and information retrieval.

I read Computer Science at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications of the University of Athens (2003-2007) before completing my M.Sc in High-Performance Computing at the University of Edinburgh (2007-2008). I obtained my Ph.D in Computer Science from King's College London (2008-2012). I also hold a Postgraduate Certificate in Academic Practice in Higher Education from King's College London (2015-2016).
