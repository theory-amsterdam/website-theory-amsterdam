I am a researcher in Computational Social Choice (COMSOC) and I study voting systems. After a PhD in the LAMSADE laboratory of Paris Dauphine University (supervised by Jérôme Lang and Dominik Peters), I am now a postdoc in the Computational Social Choice group of the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC) at the University of Amsterdam, under the supervision of Ulle Endriss.
