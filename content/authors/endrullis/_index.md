I am Assistant Professor in the Theoretical Computer Science group at the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. My research is at the intersection of term rewriting systems, automata theory, and infinite strings. In my VIDI project Automata Transforming Streams we develop fundamental theory to reason about the power and limitations of finite automata for transforming streams.
